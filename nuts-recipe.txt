Rosemary Roasted Walnuts
Makes 3 cups
(Adapted from Three Many Cooks)

    2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary
    2 teaspoons brown sugar
    1 teaspoon Kosher salt
    1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    3 cups walnuts

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

Combine the olive oil, rosemary, brown sugar, salt, and cayenne in a small mixing bowl.  Whisk to combine well.

Place the walnuts in a large mixing bowl, and pour the olive oil and spice mixture over the walnuts. Toss together until the walnuts are evenly coated.

Spread the walnuts out on a baking sheet in a single layer, and bake for 10 minutes. Cool the nuts completely on the baking sheet before transferring to an airtight container.
